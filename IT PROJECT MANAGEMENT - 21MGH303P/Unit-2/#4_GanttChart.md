**What is the Gantt Chart?**
A Gantt Chart is a visual project management timeline that consists of horizontal bars, usually color-coded.
➜These bars show all the project tasks, when they are due, who is responsible, and how long each task will take.
➜Therefore, Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project.
➜In other words, the Gantt chart assembles all pieces of tasks that are relative to a fixed deadline. 

**What is the Purpose of a Gantt Chart?**
Essentially, a Gantt chart arranges project tasks on a visual timeline, making it simple for project, programme, and portfolio managers to sketch out project plans. Gantt charts are utilised in resource management, project planning, project scheduling, and project tracking, among many other areas.

➜Break down the project into manageable tasks, identify dependencies, and allocate resources effectively.
➜Determine the sequence and duration of tasks, establishing a timeline for the project.
➜Monitor the progress of tasks, compare planned versus actual timelines, and identify any delays or issues.
➜Share project plans and progress with stakeholders, team members, and clients in a clear and understandable format.
➜Ensure that all team members are aware of their responsibilities and deadlines, facilitating collaboration and coordination within the project.

**Who Invented the Gantt Chart?**
The American mechanical engineer and management consultant Henry Gantt is honoured with the moniker Gantt chart, which he invented in the 1910s. This visual scheduling tool was created by Gantt to help in managing and controlling the production of items in manufacturing environments. His invention of Gantt charts, which are still widely used in many industries today, had a major role in the advancement of project management techniques.
Basic components of a Gantt chart

Gantt charts could initially appear difficult. However, if you can interpret them, you'll be able to determine precisely where your initiatives stand and what has to be done to steer them towards success.

**Understanding how the various components work together to create a gantt chart** is the key to reading one. Here are the following components of a Gantt Chart:
➜Task list
➜Timeline
➜Dateline
➜Bars
➜Milestones
➜Dependencies
➜Progress
➜Resource assigned

**Features of Gantt Chart**
➜**1. Helps in Project Management**
The Gantt Chart gives us a high-level interpretation of the Project timeline using which we can schedule our Project Delivery, wrap up the pending tasks, and extend the timeline according to the requirement.
➜**2. Simple to Use**
It has a drag-and-drop feature that enables us to easily make changes or update the timeframes of the tasks.
➜**3. Supports Integration with Existing Projects**
You can easily integrate the Gantt Chart into your existing Project Workflow. Therefore, you do not need to create the Gantt Log from scratch.
➜**4. Ideal for Complex Projects**
If the project structure is complex with multiple tasks or issues and the subtasks within them, the Gantt Chart serves as a proven solution to easily manage the complex work breakdown structure.
➜**5. Provides Useful Insights along with Timelines**
A Gantt chart does not only deliver an overview of the sequence of events, but it also provides important information for project managers. Also, it visualizes the critical path and hence guides the schedulers’ attention to those activities that are crucial and deserve a specific treatment

**Advantages of Gantt Chart**

➜Easy identification of tasks: The Gantt Chart helps us to easily identify the various tasks, their inter-relation, and the Progress of the tasks.
➜Helps to evaluate critical resources utilization: We can evaluate the critical Resources and their utilization, Dependencies, and Impacts of schedule changes in the Gantt Chart. Along with this, we can also create Visual alerts in case of scheduling conflicts.
➜Helps to manage tasks order: The Gantt chart equips the project experts with the capabilities to manage the order in which tasks need to be carried out so that we can easily identify the priority of the activities. In Project Execution. 

**Disadvantages of Gantt Chart**

➜Time-consuming: Setting up the Gantt Chart includes various activities such as planning the tasks, resources, timelines, due dates, dependencies, etc. This makes the Gantt Chart a time-consuming tool for the project.
➜Can turn into complex sheets: Putting too much information about the Project timelines can turn the Gantt Chart into complex sheets, due to which timeline management becomes challenging.
➜Sometimes tough to update Gantt Chart: If the Project includes the switching between multiple tools and platforms for the task execution, it is tough to update the Gantt Chart we need to configure it repeatedly, as the workflow switches to another platform. 

**When to use the Gantt Chart?**
The Gantt Chart has evolved into various forms according to the dynamic workflow in modern software development. Thus, we must figure out where the Gannt Chart is exactly suitable. You should select the Gantt Chart as your timeline management tool if you want to:

➜Manage the complex project structure with a huge number of tasks and subtasks within them.
➜Give priority to the timeline of the deliverables associated with your Project so that the end user can be satisfied.
➜Identify the relations and dependencies among the various tasks in the Project to make them organized for sequential execution.

**How to Create a Gantt Chart?**
Although creating a Gantt Chart depends on multiple factors such as project status, its current phase, team size, deadlines, structure of tasks, and subtasks, it is easy to create it for your Project. The various steps in creating the Gantt Chart are stated below.

➜Step 1: List out every task you will need to complete to finish the project. For example, you can mention tasks such as Backend Configuration, Database Integration, Testing and Validation, Deployment, etc.
➜Step 2: Define chronological order and put each task in order of when it needs to be done. Also, identify whether some tasks depend on others or they need to be completed before any other tasks.
➜Step 3: Estimate how much time it will take you to complete each task to a level of quality that has been defined during the requirement elicitation and gathering.
➜Step 4: In this step, assign a realistic due date and start dates for each task. You should analyze whether the task execution will need some extra time or not.
➜Step 5: Fill up your Gantt Chart and Continuously update your Gantt chart with actual timelines.
