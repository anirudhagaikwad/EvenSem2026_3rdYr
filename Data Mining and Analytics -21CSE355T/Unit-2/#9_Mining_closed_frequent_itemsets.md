**Mining closed frequent itemsets** in data mining identifies itemsets that appear above a minimum support threshold and have no superset with the same frequency. This technique acts as a, reduced, and more efficient representation of all frequent itemsets. 
It reduces the number of generated patterns while retaining full information for association rule mining. 

**Key Concepts and Characteristics Definition**: 
An itemset X is closed if none of its immediate supersets have the same support count as X.Purpose: To produce a smaller, concise set of results compared to traditional frequent itemset mining, which can produce an exponential number of patterns.Information Preservation: Unlike maximal itemsets, closed itemsets allow for the reconstruction of all frequent itemsets and their exact support counts.Relation to Others: The relationship is: Frequent Itemsets \supseteq  Closed Frequent Itemsets \supseteq  Maximal Frequent Itemsets. Algorithms for Mining AprioriClose: A level-wise approach that prunes the search space by identifying items with identical support.CHARM: An efficient algorithm that uses an IT-tree (itemset-tidset) search space and skips non-closed sets using hash-based techniques.NEclatClosed: A vertical mining algorithm that is faster at finding closed itemsets.Strategies: Pruning involves avoiding expanding itemsets that do not increase support and only keeping those where no superset has the same support. Why Use Closed Frequent Itemsets? Reduced Size: In dense datasets, the number of closed itemsets is significantly smaller than the total number of frequent itemsets.Efficiency: Finding only the closed sets is much faster than finding all frequent sets, especially in highly correlated data.Data Compression: It provides a condensed summary of the data without losing critical information, enhancing interpretability.
